                        Then on the last third of the paage, you have additional content like a side bar to help navigate the website. They also 
                        included a picture that help  explain what the rule is through visual example.

                    <p class="description"> The creator of the website did a decent job visually aligning his site.
                        What really caught my attendtion was the example of a wire frame they put together. It shows how each peice of the website should be through through on where it will be placed so the it will be visally appealing to the user's eye.
